This released heat partially accumulates in the adsorbent, causing a temperature rise on its surface, which in turn can decelerate the adsorption process - as adsorption is an exothermic process.\n\nPredicting equilibrium loading at a given temperature and pressure often receives greater focus. However, accurately predicting the energy release as a function of these same variables is equally critical, as it is as impactful as loading in the adsorption process.\n\nOn an energetically heterogeneous surface, the isosteric heat decreases as surface loading increases. Isotherms like the single-site Langmuir model, which assume a constant heat of adsorption regardless of surface loading, are therefore often inadequate for accurately representing experimental data in many cases.\n\nOther isotherms can account for surface heterogeneity such as Toth:\n\nn = fracMKP(1 + M(K P)^f)^1f\n\nHowever, exhibits an unrealistic infinitely large negative value at high surface loading. below you can see the behavior of the isosteric heat for the toth isotherm as a function of the loading. You can also see the comparison of the analytical expression (which is very tedious to derive) and the one given by Langmuir.jl with automatic differentiation.\n\nusing Langmuir, Plots\ntoth = Toth(7.464, 3.6e-7, 8.3144*-5649.81, 0.5, 50.22)\np_range = 1e-5:500.0:10*101325.0 |> collect\nloading_350_t = loading.(toth, p_range, 350.0)\nloading_300_t = loading.(toth, p_range, 300.0)\nΔH_350_t = isosteric_heat.(toth, p_range, 350.0)\nΔH_300_t = isosteric_heat.(toth, p_range, 300.0)\nplot(loading_300_t/toth.M, ΔH_300_t, framestyle=:box, title = \"Toth\", xlabel = \"covered fraction\", ylabel = \"ΔH (J/mol)\", label = \"Automatic Differentiation - 300 K\")\nplot!(loading_350_t/toth.M, ΔH_350_t, framestyle=:box, label = \"Automatic Differentiation - 350 K\")\n\nfunction Q_st1(model::Toth, n1, T)\n    E1 = model.E\n    β = model.β\n    R = 8.31446261815324  # Assuming Rgas gives the gas constant for the type of T\n    f = model.f₀ - model.β / T\n    n1_0 = model.M  # Assuming saturation loading as reference loading\n\n    # Calculate the two terms inside the brackets in the equation\n    term1 = log.(n1 ./ n1_0) ./ (1 .- (n1 ./ n1_0).^f)\n    term2 = log.((n1 ./ n1_0) ./ (1 .- (n1 ./ n1_0).^f).^(1/f))\n\n    # Calculate Q_st1 using the main formula\n    Q_st1_value = E1 .+ (β * R / f) * (term2 .- term1)\n    return Q_st1_value\nend\n\nΔH_analytical = Q_st1(toth, loading_350_t, 350.0)\n\nscatter!(loading_350_t/toth.M, ΔH_analytical,\n label = \"Analytical - 350 K\", m = (3, :white, stroke(1, :red)))\n\nIt can be noticed that the isosteric heat for the Toth isotherm blows for high surface coverages. \n\nMulti-site Langmuir can also account for surface heterogeneity.

As highlighted in existing literature, the thermodynamic Langmuir model offers more accurate estimates of isosteric heat while maintaining high predictive accuracy for equilibrium loading. It can also be use to predict binary adsorption. \n\nAnalytical expressions for the isosteric heat can become quite extensive. In fact, there is an entire manuscript dedicated to deriving such expressions for a number of isotherms. \n\nIn Langmuir.jl, we leverage automatic differentiation to get accurate estimates of the required derivatives for the isosteric heat without requiring such extensive derivations.","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#supported_models","page":"Supported models","title":"Supported Isotherms","text":"Here you can find the list of supported isotherm models.\n\nPages = [\"models.md\"]\n\nPages = [\"models.md\"]","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#No-parameter-Isotherm-Models","page":"Supported models","title":"No-parameter Isotherm Models","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#One-parameter-Isotherm-Models","page":"Supported models","title":"One-parameter Isotherm Models","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#Three-parameter-Isotherm-Models","page":"Supported models","title":"Three-parameter Isotherm Models","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#Four-or-more-parameter-Isotherm-Models","page":"Supported models","title":"Four or more parameter Isotherm Models","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"models/models/#Langmuir.ZeroIsotherm","page":"Supported models","title":"Langmuir.ZeroIsotherm","text":"`ZeroIsotherm()`\n\nZeroIsotherm <: IsothermModel\n\nZeroIsotherm represents an isotherm that has no adsorption. it can be used to define carrier gases.\n\nDescription\n\nA zero isotherm is defined by:\n\nn = 0\n\nwhere:\n\nn is the loading of the adsorbate on the adsorbent\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"models/models/#Langmuir.Henry","page":"Supported models","title":"Langmuir.Henry","text":"`Henry(Kh, E)`\n\nHenry <: IsothermModel\n\nInputs\n\nKh::T: Affinity parameter, or Henry’s constant at T → ∞ [mol/kg/Pa]\nE::T: Adsorption energy, [J/mol]\n\nDescription\n\nThe Henry isotherm model describes the adsorption of gases on solid surfaces at low pressures, where the amount of adsorbate adsorbed is directly proportional to the pressure of the gas.

Note that keeping this order is crucial for the isotherm_data function to work correctly.\n\nIn the file, pressure unit is in bar, temperature in Kelvin and loading in mmol/g or mol/kg. \n\nLet's read and visualize the isotherms at the different temperatures.

In this tutorial, the same strategy is used. Note that the bounds for the parameters were be manually set since the default ones were too large. Once the bounds are custom, you also need to provide the initial guess. We have default initial guesses for each isotherm, but to expose it, you need to import the x0_guess_fit function. We also import the to_vec function to convert the initial guess into a vector format, which is required by the fitting problem.\n\nAlso observe that the argument next to d_ethane is nothing.

For example, the parameter M was estimated at 3.68 in the manuscript, while it is 3.64 in this analysis. However, the energy parameters exhibit a greater discrepancy. Without calorimetric data, it's challenging to determine the accuracy of these values, as parameter identifiability is limited when relying solely on loading data.\n\n#Ethane isosteric heat\nis_283K = d_ethane.T .== 283.0\nP_C₂_283K = d_ethane.p[is_283K]\nl_C₂_283K = d_ethane.l[is_283K]\nΔH_C₂_283K = isosteric_heat.(ethane_isotherm, P_C₂_283K, 283.0)\n\n#Ethylene isosteric heat\nis_283K_ethylene = d_ethylene.T .== 283.0\nP_C₂₌_283K = d_ethylene.p[is_283K_ethylene]\nl_C₂₌_283K = d_ethylene.l[is_283K_ethylene]\nΔH_C₂₌_283K = isosteric_heat.(ethylene_isotherm, P_C₂₌_283K, 283.0) \n\nscatter(l_C₂_283K, ΔH_C₂_283K, xlabel = \"Loading (mol/kg)\", ylabel = \"Isosteric Heat (J/mol)\", m = (4, :white, stroke(1, :lightslateblue)), markershape = :circle, label = \"Ethane - 283.0 K\", size = (600, 300))\nscatter!(l_C₂₌_283K, ΔH_C₂₌_283K, xlabel = \"Loading (mol/kg)\", ylabel = \"Isosteric Heat (J/mol)\", markershape = :square, m = (3, :white, stroke(1, :springgreen2)), label = \"Ethylene - 283.0 K\")\n\nThe plot shows the isosteric heat of adsorption for ethane and ethylene at 283.0 K as a function of loading. Ethane exhibits a steeper decline in adsorption heat, suggesting stronger initial interactions that weaken significantly as loading increases, whereas ethylene's decline is more gradual, indicating a slower reduction in adsorption strength. \n\nLastly, the final analysis will utilize IAST to make predictions on the binary adsorption of ethane and ethylene. There are two ways to use IAST in Langmuir.jl.  You can directly use the iast function, which gives you access to extra solution parameters such as convergence criteria, total loading and composition. Another way is to wrap the isotherms into the IASTModels type and use it to estimate quantities such as the loading and the isosteric heat.

To do it, you can use custom plot call to visualize isotherms using plot(isotherm, T, P_range), where T is the temperature you want to analyze, P_range is a Tuple specifying minimum and maximum of the range.

For the Langmuir model, the isosteric heat should be constant and equal to the energy parameter E. You can plot the isosteric heat either as a function of the pressure or loading.\n\nBoth the loading and isosteric_heat functions were made to accept scalar arguments.

Let's try a few models to see which one fits the data best. The Langmuir package provides a variety of isotherm models, including LangmuirS1, Toth, Sips and Thermodynamic Langmuir. \n\nFitting a Langmuir model is quite simple as the parameters are easy to initialize. We will use it as an initial guess for all models, but we want to compare first the Langmuir single-site model with the Thermodynamic Langmuir model, which is an implicit model that takes into consideration an activity coefficient.  \n\nusing Langmuir\nalg = DEIsothermFittingSolver(max_steps = 500, population_size = 100,\nlogspace = true, verbose = true)\nprob_lang = IsothermFittingProblem(LangmuirS1, CH4_data, abs2)\nloss_lang, model_lang = fit(prob_lang, alg)\nplot!(fig1, model_lang, 273.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :blue)\nplot!(fig1, model_lang, 298.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :green)\nplot!(fig1, model_lang, 323.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :red)\n\nNow, we will compare similar models, i.e., the Toth and Sips models, which are both more complex than the Langmuir model. The Toth model is a more flexible model that can fit a wider range of isotherm shapes, while the Sips model is a combination of the Langmuir and Freundlich models.\n\nx0_tlang = [model_lang.M, model_lang.K₀, model_lang.E, -1e-10]\nlb_tlang = (1e-10, 1e-25, -70_000.0, -2000.0)\nub_tlang = (20.0, 1e-1, -1000.0, 0.0)\ncalorimetric_data = nothing # No calorimetric data available for this example\nprob_tlang = IsothermFittingProblem(ThermodynamicLangmuir, CH4_data, calorimetric_data, abs2, x0_tlang, lb_tlang, ub_tlang)\nalg = DEIsothermFittingSolver(max_steps = 1000, population_size = 500,\nlogspace = true, verbose = true, time_limit = 15)\nloss_tlang, model_tlang = fit(prob_tlang, alg)\nplot!(fig1, model_tlang, 273.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :blue, linestyle = :dot)\nplot!(fig1, model_tlang, 298.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :green, linestyle = :dot)\nplot!(fig1, model_tlang, 323.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :red, linestyle = :dot)\n\nThe Toth model is more trick to fit as the f parameter is made temperature dependent. The default bounds for the parameters are too large, so we need to set them manually. The fitted Langmuir above can be used as a good initial guess for the parameters.\n\nnote: Note\nIt is important to set a time limit for the optimization algorithm to prevent it from running indefinitely in search of a better fit - from previous experience, you won't need more than 10s to fit an isotherm with a good initial guess. You can do this by setting the time_limit parameter in the DEIsothermFittingSolver constructor.\n\nfig2 = Plots.plot()\nxlabel = \"Pressure (MPa)\"\nylabel = \"Loading (mol/kg)\"\nplot!(fig2, CH4_data, 273.0, label = \"CH4 at 273K\", markershape = :hexagon, xlabel = xlabel, ylabel = ylabel, m = (4, :white, stroke(1, :blue)), size = (800, 350), legend_columns=1)\nplot!(fig2, CH4_data, 298.0, label = \"CH4 at 298K\", markershape = :square, m = (4, :white, stroke(1, :green)))\nplot!(fig2, CH4_data, 323.0, label = \"CH4 at 323K\", markershape = :circle, m = (4, :white, stroke(1, :red)))\n\n\nx0_toth = [model_lang.M, model_lang.K₀, model_lang.E, 1.0, -1e-10]\nlb_toth = (1e-10, 1e-25, -70_000.0, 0.0, -300.0)\nub_toth = (20.0, 1e-1, -1000.0, 2.0, 0.0)\ncalorimetric_data = nothing # No calorimetric data available for this example\nprob_toth = IsothermFittingProblem(Toth, CH4_data, calorimetric_data, abs2, x0_toth, lb_toth, ub_toth)\nalg = DEIsothermFittingSolver(max_steps = 500, population_size = 100,\nlogspace = true, verbose = true, time_limit = 15)\nloss_toth, model_toth = fit(prob_toth, alg)\nplot!(fig2, model_toth, 273.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :blue, linestyle = :dash)\nplot!(fig2, model_toth, 298.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :green, linestyle = :dash)\nplot!(fig2, model_toth, 323.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :red, linestyle = :dash)\n\nA good reminder about our formulation of the Toth model is that the f parameter has a temperature dependency of f = f_0 - fracbetaT. The beta parameter is initially defined with bounds in (-infty infty) while f_0 is bounded to (0 infty). However, it is good practice to investigate the direction in which beta value changes with temperature. After empirical testing, it became evident that beta should be constrained to the interval (-infty 0) instead of including positive numbers and the bounds were updated accordingly. Nevertheless, the fitted model tends to push beta to the lower bound, effectively driving the f_0 term towards zero, i.e., the temperature dependency of f that leads to the lowest fitting error effectively becomes f = -fracbetaT. \n\nThis behavior reflects a common issue in isotherm models with a high number of parameters: parameter correlation leads to identifiability problems, where different parameter combinations can yield similar loss values. As a result, optimization may favor extreme values that are not physically meaningful. \n\nx0_sips = [model_lang.M, model_lang.K₀, model_lang.E, 1.0, -1.0]\nlb_sips = (1e-10, 1e-25, -70_000.0, 0.0, -300.0)\nub_sips = (20.0, 1e-1, -1000.0, 2.0, 0.0)\nprob_sips = IsothermFittingProblem(Sips, CH4_data, calorimetric_data, abs2, x0_sips, lb_sips, ub_sips)\nalg = DEIsothermFittingSolver(max_steps = 500, population_size = 100,\nlogspace = true, verbose = true, time_limit = 15)\nloss_sips, model_sips = fit(prob_sips, alg)\nplot!(fig2, model_sips, 273.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :blue, linestyle = :dashdot)\nplot!(fig2, model_sips, 298.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :green, linestyle = :dashdot)\nplot!(fig2, model_sips, 323.0, (0.0, maximum(CH4_data.p)), color = :red, linestyle = :dashdot)\n\nYou can build a table with the results of the fitting to compare the models. The parameters field of the IsothermModel structure contains the fitted parameters, and the loss variable contains the loss of the fitting, i.e., mathcalL = sum_i^N frac(q_i - q*_i)^2sigma^2_i.

However, it can be seen that all measurements are assigned the same variance, which is not the case in reality. Low pressure measurements are more uncertain than high pressure ones, so we can assign a higher variance to the low pressure points and see the consequences in the fitting process. You can do this by modifying the σ² field of the IsothermData structure.","category":"section"},{"location":"#Langmuir.jl","page":"Home","title":"Langmuir.jl","text":"Langmuir.jl is a Julia library designed to model adsorption equilibria for both single and multi-component systems.\n\nFor single-component adsorption, the library offers a wide range of isotherms, from simple one-parameter models like Henry's law to more complex two- and three-parameter models such as the Langmuir (Single and MultiSite), Freundlich, Temkin, Redlich-Peterson, Toth, and Sips isotherms.
